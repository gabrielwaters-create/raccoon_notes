## üé® App Icon

Raccoon Notes comes with its own custom app icon (`raccoon_icon.png`).  
You can use this icon when creating a desktop shortcut or launcher for the app.

<details>
<summary><strong>Advanced: Add to Applications (Linux/Ubuntu)</strong></summary>

1. Make sure you have the app icon file (e.g., `raccoon_icon.png`) in your project folder.
2. Install Tkinter (GUI support) and Pillow (image support) system-wide:
   ```
   
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install python3.12-tk python3-pil python3-pil.imagetk -y

   
   ```
3. Run the app manually (First Test)
   ```
    /usr/bin/python3.12 /path/to/raccoon_notes_app.py

   ```

4. Create a `.desktop` file in your applications directory:  
   ```bash
   nano ~/.local/share/applications/raccoon-notes.desktop
   ```
4. Add the following content (update paths if needed):  
   ```
   [Desktop Entry]
   Name=Raccoon Notes
   Comment=Lightweight raccoon-themed notes app
   Exec=/usr/bin/python3.12 /path/to/raccoon_notes_app.py
   Path=/path/to/raccoon_notes
   Icon=/path/to/raccoon_icon.png
   Terminal=false
   Type=Application
   Categories=Utility;
   ```
5. Save and close.  
6. Run:  
   ```bash
   chmod +x ~/.local/share/applications/raccoon-notes.desktop
   ```
7. Now you can find **Raccoon Notes** in your app menu with the custom icon.
